The objective of the analysis was identify bad car buys for a second hand car sales business in order to help them avoid cars that were bad and develop an inventory of quality cars. Analysis was conducted using various SVM parameters in SAS Enterprise Miner. https://github.com/melissaEYE/Support-Vector-Machines

The dataset for the project was “car lemon dataset.csv”.

The purpose of the analysis was to differentiate the bad vehicle purchases, from good vehicle purchases.  More specifically:
a)	To look for key attributes that help to classify a vehicle as a “bad” purchase
b)	To buy more quality vehicles for the organization to sell
c)	To provide higher quality vehicles to customers leading to improved customer satisfaction
     
The car lemon dataset included 34 variables and 72,983 rows or observations. The type of variables included numeric (n = 15) and character (n = 19) variables. Of the numeric variables, 11 were interval, the other two were binary. 

To accomplish the purpose of the analysis the variable “Is Bad Buy” was the identified as the dependent or target binary variable. “0” indicates that the purchase was not a bad buy, and “1” which indicates the purchase was a bad buy.  The target variable was unevenly proportioned and skewed heavily in favor of “0” values or not bad purchases (n = 64,007; 87.70%). Bad purchases totaled 8,976 of the 72,983 observations (12.30%).
